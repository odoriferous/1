As the intermediary court decision from 29 November 2021, the escrowed XRP is to be released from escrow and ordered to be distributed amongst existing clients, as the ownership cannot be maintained by Ripple any longer. So, this is good news for XRP holders with aged accounts and positive balances with more than 1000 XRP.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The remainder of 500,000,000 XRP is to be distributed to the open community as instructed in the aforementioned order&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>Cumulative properties:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Self-owned (restricted to exchange or business accounts)</li><li>Claimed balances cannot be used for other claims</li><li>Newly created accounts cannot receive claims</li></ul><p>If your account is in compliance with the distribution terms, you may register and enter a claim for the escrowed XRP.&nbsp;</p><p>XRP Escrow account:<br><a href="https://bithomp.com/explorer/rfWPPQBYqYmoFMdVnjzXCagJbz5uajSBXL" target="_blank">https://bithomp.com/explorer/rfWPPQBYqYmoFMdVnjzXCagJbz5uajSBXL</a></p><p>Escrow was released on 1 December 2021:<br><a href="https://bithomp.com/explorer/6E36F0460C31095215640E4EBDE60D42308BF66DDCBA41F44D7B7E100B460788" target="_blank">https://bithomp.com/explorer/6E36F0460C31095215640E4EBDE60D42...</a></p><p>From the escrowed XRP, on December 1st, 2021, half of the total unlocked amount has been moved into cold storage and half is to be distributed to users&rsquo; accounts, as the court order states.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>300M XRP moved to Ripple Cold Storage</li><li>200M XRP moved to Ripple Cold Storage 2</li><li>500M XRP to be distributed amongst existing users</li></ul><p>Starting on July 5th 2022, after the expiration of the 220-day term from the case trial date, the Distribution of the escrow-released XRP for staking with 4 different plans:</p><ul><li>1 month with 3% APR</li><li>3 months with 7.5% APR</li><li>6 months with 12.5% APR</li><li>1 year with 30% APR</li></ul><p>The lockdown period is fixed for the aforementioned plans and the staked XRP can be unlocked at any given moment.
